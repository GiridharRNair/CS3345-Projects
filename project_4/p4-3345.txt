Ver 1.0: Initial description.

Due: 11:59 PM, Saturday, Dec 14.

This is as an individual project. Do not share your work with others. 
Do not use the code from any outside sources.
ANY SUSPICION OF PLAGIARISM WILL BE REPORTED to OCSC.


Project Description

Implement the PERT algorithm discussed in class.  Starter code (PERT.java) provided.
Implement all the methods in the starter code. Write additional methods if needed.
Driver code (P4Driver) and test cases are all also provided. (See project 4 folder in the shared box folder.)

Do not change the name of the class.  
Do not modify Graph class other than changing the netid.
Do not change the signatures of public methods in the starter code.
If you need additional classes, define them as nested classes of PERT.

You must write the DFS-based algorithm for finding a topological order.

Your code should be well structured and commented properly. Please follow format specified in Javadoc. 

Follow the submission below. 
IF YOU DID NOT FOLLOW THE SUBMISSION PROCEDURE, 10 POINTS WILL BE DEDUCTED 

Submission procedure:

* Create a folder whose name is your netid (Nid). The name should be in lower case. 
* Place PERT.java, and Graph.java in that folder. 
* Use "package Nid;" in all your java files. Nid should be in lower case
* package name and folder name should exactly match
* Zip the contents into a single zip file.
* If the zip file is bigger than 1 MB, you have included unnecessary files.
* Delete them and create the zip file again.
* Upload the zip file on elearning. 
* Submission can be revised before the deadline. 
* The final submission before the deadline will be graded.
